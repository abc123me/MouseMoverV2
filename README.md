# Mouse mover V2
<br>
As a high school student I see that alot of teachers have the problem that thier computer
goes into sleep mode because the mouse hasn't been moved in 15 or so minutes so to fix this
I made a simple, Java program that moves the mouse
<br><br>
Sadly, In most situations the teachers themseleves can't fix this because 
they don't have administrator privledges on thier own computers
